# MasterThemePlugin
This theme is a descendant theme of default theme in OJS 3.3.0-8

This theme is not designed to be chosen as the active theme by a journal.
It needs to be activated as a theme plugin for journals with child themes of this.
It is designed to contain modifications overriding default theme which should be inherited by all child themes.
This is the theme to make changes that will be in effect for all journal themes.

The language key: msgid "plugins.themes.master.header.html" is intentionally left black for this plugin.
If a child theme of MasterThemePlugin overrides this with some html-content,
then that content will be displayed in the page header.
