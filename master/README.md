# MasterThemePlugin
This theme is a descendant theme of default theme in OJS 3.2.1-2

This theme is not designed to be chosen as the active theme by a journal, but is designed to contain modifications to default theme and templates that should affect all themes inheriting from it (unless specifically overridden by inheriting themes).

The language key: msgid "plugins.themes.master.header.html" is intentionally left black for this plugin.
If a child theme of MasterThemePlugin overrides this with some html-content, then that content will be displayed in the page header.
