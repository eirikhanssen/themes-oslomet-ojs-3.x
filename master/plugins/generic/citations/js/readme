This version of citations.js is a slight modifications of plugins/generic/citations/js/citations.js 
which changes the html code used to display the references a bit.

To use this, rename plugins/generic/citations/js/citations.js to plugins/generic/citations/js/citations.js.original
and create a symlink from plugins/generic/citations/js/citations.js -> plugins/themes/master/plugins/generic/citations/citations.js
